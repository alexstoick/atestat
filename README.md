'Warehousing' - final year project

This will be a simple website developed with Bootstrap. It will serve as an interface to a warehousing database, 
with basic operations can be made: moving an item, reserving an item, receiving an item within an item order, and also
checking out some items that are needed for a project.

All these features will have separate pages. For now there are:

(1) table.php - outputs the main part of the website: the table which shows items and the basic operations that can be
				performed with them.
